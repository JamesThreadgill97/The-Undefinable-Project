# Welcome to the History Hangman Game created by The Undefinables!

The aim of this project was to create an interactive web game for students aged 13-18, to help build their knowledge on historical figure through a fun and engaging hangman game. The subject-areas we have focused on are Science, History and Literature which covers most non-STEM subjects.

History Hangman is an application that allows the student to start playing a normal hangman game and requires them to guess the name of the historical figure based on the description given. Two hints are also provided per round to help guess the historical figure! The maximum number of letters they are allowed to get wrong is 8. 

If they manage to get the name of the historical figure right, a photo of them appears. If you click on the photo, you will sent to the wikipedia page for that historical figure. This allows the student to have a better representation of the historical figure and learn in a visual way.
