Welcome to the History Hangman Game created by The Undefinables!

The aim of this project was to create an interactive web game for students aged 13-18, to help build their knowledge on Historians through a fun and engaging hangman game. The subject-areas we have focused on are Science, History and Literature which covers most non-STEM subjects.

History Hangman is an application that allows the student to start playing a normal hangman game and requires them to guess the name of the historian based on the description given. Two hints are also provided per round to help guess the historian! The maximum number of letters they are allowed to get wrong is 8. 
If they manage to get the name of the historian right, a photo of them appears. This allows the student to have a better representation of the historian and learn in a visual way.
